Things To Do:
- Hosting -> Done
- Name -> Done
- Learn HTML/CSS/JS -> More advanced knowledge can be learnt as we expand functionality
- Add the same styling to all pages
- Start making tables filled with non-interactive content (past papers/specifications)
- Learn how to make basic interactive questions, where images randomly change and the user can input an answer, which is then marked
- Do we want the navbar on every page? If so, we'll need to copy paste, or use a template thingy?
  Answer from Ivan: Yes, that way we can switch between the subsections from every page. There's only a few pages, so we can just easily copy+paste
