Things To Do:
- Hosting -> Github pages setup is almost finished. Publishing source needs to be set to the main/root fork, and we need to be certain that everything is up and running
- Name -> almost ready to be set up, as of now Tiffin.GQ should be redirecting to the site.
- Learn HTML for everyone (HTML is a fairly simple don't think it'd take too long to pick up)
- Also for style CSS can be used its easy to pick up and much easier to use with HTML.
- Static for now.
